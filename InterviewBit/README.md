| # | Title | Solution | My Approach |
|---| ----- | -------- | --------------------- |
| 1 | [Spiral Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/submissions/) || 1. Take Index for  start and end of row and column<br>2. On Traversing a row/Col remove it and decrease or Increase start and End of Corresponding row/Column|
| 2 | [Prime Sum](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/math/problems/prime-sum/)| ||
| 3 | [Largest Coprime Divisor](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/math/problems/largest-coprime-divisor/)| ||

| 6 | [Kth Node From Middle](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/kth-node-from-middle/)| ||
| 7 | [Balanced Parantheses!](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/balanced-parantheses/)| ||
| 8 | [Even Reverse](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/even-reverse/)| ||
| 9 | [First non-repeating character in a stream of characters](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/first-non-repeating-character-in-a-stream-of-characters/)| ||
| 10| [Redundant Braces](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/redundant-braces/)| ||
| 11 | [Reverse Alternate K Nodes](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/reverse-alternate-k-nodes/)| ||
| 12 | [K reverse linked list](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/k-reverse-linked-list/)| ||
| 13 | [2-sum](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/2-sum/)| |1. Since index1< index 2 required we can start from left and break at the first occurence of answer<br> 2. If not store in hashMap current value and index of relative index for present. First answer gives lowest index |
| 14 | [MAXSPPROD](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/maxspprod/)| ||
| 15 | [Diffk](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/diffk-ii/)| |1. Since K>=0 two case arise mod(A-B)= k <br> 2. hence two scenarios are A = B+k && A =B-k <br> 3. Put is ArrayList and check for above two cases presence. |
| 16 | [Maximal String](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/maximal-string/)| |1. Two case arise for next index > current then swap 897 -- 987 <br> 2. When next index <= current then do not swap, but B swaps still available for remaining 987/997 --> 987/997 <br> 3. Use Backtracking to solve this|
